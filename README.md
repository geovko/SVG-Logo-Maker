## Description

Since the development of a logo may not be a priority for certain projects where a simple logo instead would suffice, the main function of this particular project (SVG Logo Maker) is to generate a simple logo for users that do not feel the need to invest in a graphic designer. There were multiple parts coming into play, including the use of fs and inquirer as well as utilizing inheritance and classes. However, the main challenge for me was understanding and producing a functioning svg file of the logo since it was the most recent concept for me to tackle. However, throughtout the process, I've come to realize that eventually things fall together; one just needs to tackle the project step-by-step until the entirety of it is complete. A balance between persisting and resting is key.

## Installation

The user must first open the terminal from the file location and input 'npm install'. Afterwards, they must input 'node index.js'

The user is then prompted to answer a list of questions which will then generate a logo.svg file based on their responses. This file will be located in the util file folder.
